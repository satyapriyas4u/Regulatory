GSPR_FILTER_PROMPT = """
You are a regulatory affairs expert specializing in medical device documentation and compliance.

Given the following device and component information, analyze and determine the applicability of each of the 23 General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) sections as per EU MDR guidelines.

Your response must return a **structured JSON list** where each item corresponds to a GSPR section. Each item must include:

- "GSPR": The section number (e.g., "1", "2", ..., "10", "11", ..., "23")  
- "Applicability": Must be one of "Applicable" or "Not Applicable"  
- "Justification": A concise and relevant explanation for why the section is or isn't applicable to the specified component and use-case.

For GSPR section **10**, return a single object with:
- "GSPR": "10"
- A nested field "Subsections": a list of objects, each with:
  - "Subsection": "10.1", "10.2", "10.3", "10.4"
  - "Applicability"
  - "Justification"
